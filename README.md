# Deep Neural Networks for Brain Computer Interfaces analysis 
Deep neural networks for analyzing recordings of Brain Computer Interfaces. 

## Overview
This is my proposal in collaboration with Enya Goñi for the application of deep neural networks to classify Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) signals of the [BCI Competition III](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iii/).  
This project consists of two main parts: the code and a report on the project in which we explain our approach in detail.

## Dependencies
### General Imports
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

### RNN 
* tensorflow
* sklearn
* statistics

### CNN 
* keras

### To load the data
* scipy


Install missing dependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). 

## Usage

Type `jupyter notebook` in terminal when in the main directory and it will pop up in your browser.

Install [jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) if you haven't yet.
